# Components

## Get started

### Our components are a collection of interface elements that can be reused across the Shopify system.

Components can be combined to help anyone building products for Shopify to efficiently design consistent experiences for merchants.

This frees us up to focus on solving unique merchant challenges, rather than reinventing interface elements that are already in use.
